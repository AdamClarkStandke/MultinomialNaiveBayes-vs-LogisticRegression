# FakeOrRealClassifier
Implementing a fake news classifier as detailed by Katharine Jarmul in her  Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python course on DataCamp and George McIntire as detaled https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/machine-learning-fake-news-accuracy.html. Dataset is from https://github.com/lutzhamel/fake-news/blob/master/data/fake_or_real_news.csv 

Additionally,contains a logistic regression model implemented from scatch as detailed by Suraj Verma in his Logistic Regression From Scratch in Python as found on Medium and by Mirko StojiljkoviÄ‡ in his Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm With Python as found on realpython. I also implemented a non-metaheurstic simulation method for finding a good enough solution to additive smoothing  parameter for sklearn's MultinomialNB classifier
